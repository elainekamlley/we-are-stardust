# we-are-stardust

> The atoms of our bodies are traceable to stars that manufactured them in their cores and exploded these enriched ingredients across our galaxy, billions of years ago. For this reason, we are biologically connected to every other living thing in the world. We are chemically connected to all molecules on Earth. And we are atomically connected to all atoms in the universe. We are not figuratively, but literally stardust. - **Neil deGrasse Tyson

## About: 

We are stardust is a project inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote. Using the Astronomy Picture of the Day API by Nasa, users are able to enter any date, a birthday or anniversary, and it will pull a image of space that was posted for that date. This allows users to see images of what we are chemically connected to. 

### Some limitations:
The API only dates back to 1994. In the future I want users only enter a month and day. The application will then pull 10 random images from various years. Users can then click and expand images to read more about them. 

## What still needs to be done:

- For captions, create a hoverover feature. When users hover over the image, the title and caption appear. 
- refactor `index.js` to ES6
